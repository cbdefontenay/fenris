# Fenris

This will be a desktop app for structuring data and creating and organizing your notes.

## Features:

There are already a lot of note-taking apps out there, so what will be different about ***Fenris***?.

1. Built-in **CLI**, so you can monitor your app, create notes, set a theme and more directly from the ***CLI*** in the
   App.
2. **Markdown** support. You'll be able to create notes in **Markdown** format, store them locally and export them.
3. **JSON** formating support.
4. Instead of copy pasting your JSON data, you can request it directly by making a URL request to the JSON output.
5. And more...

Overall, this will be an ***All-in*** app.
